## 1. Introduction & Goals

### 1.1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new web application designed to serve as a central hub for a gaming clan focused on the browser game "Total Battle". The application will integrate community features (news, discussions, events) with specialized data analysis tools derived from a previous Python desktop application ("ChestBuddy"). The goal is to create a modern, reliable, and engaging platform for clan members.

### 1.2. Goals

*   **Community Hub:** Provide a central online location for clan communication, news, announcements, and event coordination.
*   **Data Analysis:** Offer tools for importing, validating, correcting, and visualizing game-specific data ("Chests") relevant to clan members and leadership.
*   **Member Engagement:** Foster a sense of community through profiles, discussions, and shared data insights.
*   **Information Resource:** Serve as a primary source for game and clan-related information for members.
*   **Modernization:** Transition functionality from an older desktop application to a modern, accessible web platform using a specific tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, etc.).
*   **Multi-Clan Support:** Structure the platform to potentially support multiple clans with distinct memberships, data, and permissions.

### 1.3. Target Audience

*   **Clan Members:** Active players within the affiliated "Total Battle" clan(s).
*   **Clan Leadership:** Owners, Administrators, Moderators responsible for managing the clan and website.
*   **Potential Recruits:** Individuals interested in learning about and potentially joining the clan(s).

## 2. User Roles, Ranks & Personas

The application will feature a tiered system of Roles and Ranks, combined with Clan affiliation, to manage permissions and access.

### 2.1. Roles

Roles define the base level of permissions across the website. Permissions are generally additive (Role + Rank) and can be scoped by Clan.

*   **Owner:**
    *   The primary website owner/superadmin.
    *   Complete access to all website features, administration, user management, clan management, and potentially underlying infrastructure/database.
    *   Can manage Administrators.
*   **Administrator:**
    *   High-level administrative privileges within the website context.
    *   Can manage users (assign roles/ranks, add/remove from clans), manage content (news, events), configure clan-specific settings (validation/correction rules), and moderate discussions.
    *   Cannot manage other Administrators or Owners. Specific capabilities configurable by the Owner.
*   **Moderator:**
    *   Focuses on content and community moderation.
    *   Can moderate discussions/comments (edit/delete), approve/reject submitted articles, manage specific user issues within their assigned clan(s).
    *   Possesses a subset of Administrator permissions, configurable by Admins/Owner.
*   **Editor:**
    *   Focuses on content creation.
    *   Can create and edit news articles/announcements for their assigned clan(s). May require approval depending on configuration.
    *   Can participate in discussions.
*   **Member:**
    *   Standard user belonging to one or more clans.
    *   Can view clan-specific content (news, data, events), participate in discussions, manage their own profile, and view the member directory.
    *   Can submit articles for approval.
*   **Guest:**
    *   A registered user who has not yet been assigned a Role/Rank/Clan by an Administrator/Moderator.
    *   Limited access. Can log in but sees a restricted dashboard (e.g., a message indicating they need assignment) and cannot access member-specific areas. Can view the public-facing page.

### 2.2. Ranks (Based on "Total Battle")

Ranks provide an additional layer for permissions and visual distinction, often reflecting in-game status. Each rank has a default associated Role, but can grant additional permissions.

*   **Anf√ºhrer / Leader:** (Default Role: Administrator)
*   **Vorgesetzter / Superior:** (Default Role: Moderator)
*   **Offizier / Officer:** (Default Role: Editor)
*   **Veteran / Veteran:** (Default Role: Member)
*   **Soldat / Soldier:** (Default Role: Member)

*(Visual distinctions like profile icons/colors associated with Ranks are desired but specific assets are TBD). These visuals should appear alongside usernames in discussions, the member directory, and potentially user profiles.*

### 2.3. Clan Affiliation

*   Users belong to one or more Clans.
*   Permissions granted by Role/Rank are typically scoped to the Clan(s) the user belongs to.
*   Administrators/Owners can configure whether certain permissions extend across multiple clans for specific users.
*   Validation, Correction, and Scoring rules are defined on a per-clan basis.

### 2.4. Personas (Example - TBD in more detail)

*   **Persona 1: Klaus (Clan Leader / Administrator)** - Needs overview of all clan activity, member management tools, ability to post announcements, configure clan rules, analyze overall clan data.
*   **Persona 2: Sabine (Officer / Editor)** - Wants to write news updates, participate in discussions, track her personal chest data, see upcoming events.
*   **Persona 3: Max (Soldier / Member)** - Wants to read news, see his stats on the dashboard, check the event calendar, message other members.
*   **Persona 4: New Applicant (Guest)** - Visits the public page, registers, waits for an Admin to assign Role/Rank/Clan.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Public Facing Website

This section describes the part of the website accessible to non-authenticated users.

*   **Purpose:** Attract potential recruits, provide general information about the clan(s), and serve as the entry point for registration/login.
*   **Content:**
    *   Clan Description(s): Information about the clan(s) hosted on the site (history, goals, focus).
    *   Recruitment Information: Details on how to apply or express interest in joining.
    *   Public News/Announcements: A selection of news articles or announcements designated as publicly visible.
    *   Contact Information (Optional): General contact method if desired.
    *   Login/Signup Links: Clear calls to action for existing members to log in or new users to register.
*   **Structure:** Single landing page or a few key public pages (e.g., Home, About, Recruitment).
*   **Design:** Professional, engaging, and reflects the clan's identity. Consistent branding with the member area.

### 3.2. User Authentication & Management

This section covers user registration, login, and profile management.

*   **Technology:** NextAuth.js will be used for handling authentication flows.
*   **Registration:**
    *   Users can register for a new account using an email address and password.
    *   Consider adding optional fields during registration (e.g., primary in-game name) or prompt for them after first login.
    *   Upon successful registration, the user is created in the database (Supabase) with the default role of "Guest".
    *   Requires email verification step before the account is fully active (standard NextAuth.js feature).
*   **Login:**
    *   Registered users can log in using their email and password.
    *   Session management handled by NextAuth.js.
    *   Include a "Forgot Password" mechanism for password recovery (standard NextAuth.js feature).
*   **Profile Management (User Settings Page):**
    *   Authenticated users (excluding Guests) can access a dedicated settings page to manage their profile.
    *   **Editable Fields:**
        *   Display Name/Alias (for website usage).
        *   Email Address (requires re-verification if changed).
        *   Password Change.
        *   Preferred Language (German/English initially).
        *   Country of Origin (Optional, perhaps a dropdown list).
        *   **Game Accounts:** A mechanism to list multiple "Total Battle" in-game names/aliases associated with their website account. This list is used for filtering data views.
            *   Input should allow adding/removing aliases via a simple text list interface.
            *   Basic format validation should be applied (e.g., check for valid characters, reasonable length).
            *   Prevent duplicate entries within the same user's list.
            *   Provide visual feedback if an entered alias matches a player name existing in the chest database (e.g., a checkmark icon).
            *   Consider allowing users to select from a dropdown/autocomplete list of player names already present in the database.
    *   **Read-Only Fields (Displayed):**
        *   Assigned Role(s).
        *   Assigned Rank(s).
        *   Assigned Clan(s).
*   **Logout:** Users can securely log out, terminating their session.

#### 3.2.1. User Deactivation/Deletion

*   **Policy:** When a user account is deactivated or deleted (action performed by Admin/Owner):
    *   User login will be disabled.
    *   Associated chest data entries should be retained by default.
    *   User-generated content (articles, comments) should be retained by default, possibly attributed to a generic "Former Member" or anonymized state.
    *   (Detailed handling, like options for full data deletion upon request, can be reviewed post-MVP).

### 3.3. Clan & Rank System

This section details the management of Clans and Ranks.

*   **Clan Management (Owner/Admin Interface - Admin Panel):**
    *   A dedicated section within an Admin Panel is required.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Create New Clan (Owner only).
        *   Edit Clan Details (Name, Description).
        *   View Clan Members.
        *   Add Registered User to Clan.
        *   Remove User from Clan.
*   **Rank Definition:**
    *   The five ranks (Leader, Superior, Officer, Veteran, Soldier) are predefined.
    *   The system associates each rank with its default role (Admin, Moderator, Editor, Member, Member respectively).
    *   Future enhancements might allow Owners to customize rank names or add new ranks, but this is not required for MVP.
*   **User Management (Admin/Moderator Interface - Admin Panel):**
    *   A dedicated section within an Admin Panel for user management.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   View All Users (filterable by Clan, Role, Rank, Status (Guest/Active)).
        *   Assign/Change User Role.
        *   Assign/Change User Rank within a specific Clan.
        *   Activate "Guest" user (implicitly by assigning Role/Rank/Clan).
        *   Deactivate/Suspend User Account.
        *   Manage Cross-Clan Permissions (Admin/Owner only, see Sec 3.4).

### 3.4. Permissions System

This section describes how access control is enforced based on Role, Rank, and Clan.

*   **Core Principle:** A user's effective permissions are the *sum* of permissions granted by their Role and their Rank, scoped by the Clan context they are currently operating within (if applicable).
*   **Permission Granularity:** The system needs a mechanism to define and check specific permissions. Examples include:
    *   `article:create`, `article:edit:own`, `article:edit:any`, `article:delete:own`, `article:delete:any`, `article:approve`
    *   `comment:create`, `comment:edit:own`, `comment:edit:any`, `comment:delete:own`, `comment:delete:any`
    *   `user:manage:role`, `user:manage:rank`, `user:manage:clan_assignment`, `user:view_directory`
    *   `profile:edit:own`, `profile:view:any`
    *   `data:import`, `data:view`, `data:edit`, `data:delete`, `data:batch_edit`, `data:batch_delete`
    *   `rules:manage` (for validation/correction/scoring)
    *   `event:create`, `event:edit`, `event:delete`
    *   `message:send:private`, `message:send:broadcast`
    *   `admin_panel:view`
*   **Role-Based Permissions:** Each Role (Owner, Admin, Mod, Editor, Member, Guest) will have a base set of predefined permissions associated with it.
*   **Rank-Based Permissions:** Each Rank can grant *additional* specific permissions on top of the user's Role-based permissions (e.g., a high-rank Member might gain `article:approve`).
*   **Clan Scoping:**
    *   By default, most permissions are clan-specific. An Editor in Clan A cannot edit articles for Clan B unless explicitly granted cross-clan permission.
    *   Data (chest data, validation/correction/scoring rules) is strictly segregated by Clan.
    *   **Cross-Clan Permissions:** An interface for Owners/Admins is required to grant specific users specific permissions across multiple clans (e.g., allowing a high-ranking Moderator to oversee discussions in several clans).
*   **Implementation:** Permissions checks must be implemented consistently across the application (API routes (tRPC), UI components) to ensure secure and correct access control.

### 3.5. Member Dashboard

This is the main landing page for authenticated users after login (excluding Guests).

*   **Layout:** Modern dashboard design, featuring a persistent left-hand navigation bar (similar to Discord) listing main application sections/features.
*   **Default Components (MVP):**
    *   **Announcements:** Display of currently active, pinned announcements for the user's clan(s).
    *   **News Feed:** A stream of recent news articles relevant to the user's clan(s).
    *   **Personal Chest Stats:** A summary section showing key statistics and potentially a chart derived from the user's associated game account data.
    *   **Clan Chest Stats:** A summary section showing key statistics and potentially a chart for the overall clan's data.
    *   **Quick Links:** A configurable section for important links (managed by Admins).
*   **Customization (Initial):**
    *   Users should be able to configure (via their Profile Settings page) which optional dashboard components are visible (e.g., hide Clan Stats, show only Personal Stats).
    *   Simple show/hide toggles are sufficient for MVP. More complex layout customization is post-MVP.
*   **Data Display:** The dashboard must correctly filter and display data relevant to the user's clan memberships and their linked game account aliases.

### 3.6. News, Announcements & Discussions

This section details the features for clan communication and information sharing.

*   **Content Creation:**
    *   Users with appropriate permissions (e.g., `article:create`) can create/edit News Articles and Announcements.
    *   A rich text editor should be provided, allowing basic formatting (bold, italic, lists), embedding images, and potentially videos. Advanced features like tables or code blocks are not required for MVP.
    *   Content can be targeted to specific Clans or marked as global (visible to all members).
*   **Announcements:**
    *   A special type of article that can be marked as "pinned".
    *   Pinned announcements appear at the top of the main News Feed and on the Member Dashboard.
*   **Approval Workflow:**
    *   A system setting (configurable by Admins) should allow Members (with `article:submit` permission, granted by default) to submit articles.
    *   Submitted articles enter a pending state and require approval from a user with `article:approve` permission before becoming visible.
*   **Discussions (Reddit-Style):**
    *   Each News Article / Announcement will have an associated discussion thread.
    *   Users with `comment:create` permission (Members+) can post comments.
    *   Comments should support basic threading.
    *   Implement **up-voting** (only) and reaction emotes on comments and articles.
    *   Support sorting comments (e.g., by time, by upvotes) and basic text search within comments of an article.
*   **Moderation:**
    *   Users with appropriate permissions (e.g., `comment:edit:any`, `comment:delete:any`, `article:edit:any`, `article:delete:any`) can moderate content.

### 3.7. Data Import & Preview

This section covers the process of getting chest data into the system.

*   **CSV Upload Interface:** A dedicated page or section accessible to users with `data:import` permission to upload CSV files or paste Pattern 2 text.
*   **Parsing Logic:**
    *   The system must correctly parse CSV files adhering to **Pattern 1** (standard columns: DATE, PLAYER, SOURCE, CHEST, SCORE, CLAN).
    *   The system must also parse raw text files/inputs adhering to **Pattern 2** (three-line entries: Chest Name, `Source: ...`, `From: ...`).
        *   Requires robust logic to extract Chest Name, Player Name (removing `From: `), Source Name (removing `Source: `).
        *   Must reliably extract Level (single number) or Level Range (e.g., 25-30) from the Source string. Store ranges using dedicated `min_level` and `max_level` columns.
        *   Must handle variations and potential noise in the input strings gracefully.
    *   **Error Handling:** If parsing errors occur (especially in Pattern 2), provide a summary list of errors and highlight the problematic lines/entries in the preview table.
*   **Date Handling (Pattern 2):**
    *   The system should attempt to extract the date (DD.MM.YYYY format) from the **uploaded filename** if provided.
    *   If no date is found in the filename, fallback to using the **upload date/time**.
    *   The user must be able to **override** the automatically determined date for the entire batch during the preview stage.
    *   This "Chest Collected Date" is distinct from metadata timestamps.
*   **Client-Side Preview:**
    *   After parsing, the data (regardless of input pattern) must be displayed in an interactive table view within the user's browser.
    *   This preview table should support sorting and basic filtering.
    *   The preview data resides temporarily in the browser memory; persistence is not required if the user navigates away.
*   **Validation/Correction/Scoring in Preview:**
    *   **Toggle Setting:** Admins should be able to configure (per clan or globally) whether Validation, Correction, and Scoring are applied *automatically* during the preview stage by default.
    *   The preview table must visually highlight cells based on validation status (using per-clan validation rules, matching based on exact value).
    *   Users must be able to see correction suggestions (based on per-clan correction rules, matching based on exact value) and apply them directly within the preview table.
    *   The Scoring System (Sec 3.8) must be applied during this stage (if enabled) for Pattern 2 data (and potentially Pattern 1) to calculate and display scores.
    *   Batch correction functionalities should be accessible from the preview interface (leading to a dedicated page/view as per Sec 1).
*   **Commit to Database:**
    *   A clear action (e.g., "Commit Data" button) allows the user to save the processed (validated, corrected, scored) preview data to the Supabase database.
    *   Committed data must be associated with the correct Clan.
    *   The system should **allow potential duplicates** upon commit, as reliable duplication detection is difficult. Responsibility lies with the user/admins managing the data.
*   **Metadata Tracking:** For each committed data row, the database must store:
    *   `createdAt`: Timestamp of initial commit.
    *   `createdBy`: User ID of the user who committed the data.
    *   `updatedAt`: Timestamp of the last modification.
    *   `updatedBy`: User ID of the user who last modified the data.
*   **User Feedback:** The UI must provide clear, non-blocking feedback during file upload, parsing (especially for large files or complex Pattern 2 data), validation/correction processes, and the final commit step.
*   **Rule Management:**
    *   Initial validation and correction rules for MVP will be pre-defined.
    *   **Admin Rule Management UI (MVP):** A dedicated admin page is required for managing Validation, Correction, and Scoring rules on a per-clan basis. This interface should allow authorized users (e.g., Admins with `rules:manage` permission) to create, view, edit, and delete rules for each category within a unified management area.

### 3.8. Scoring System

This system assigns scores to chest data entries based on configurable rules.

*   **Purpose:** To standardize scoring for data imported via Pattern 2 and allow potential re-scoring of any data.
*   **Rule Definition:**
    *   Scoring rules are defined per Clan.
    *   Each rule specifies matching criteria based on:
        *   Chest Name (exact match or pattern).
        *   Source Name (exact match or pattern).
        *   Level or Level Range (matching against `min_level`/`max_level`).
    *   Each rule defines a numeric Score to be assigned if the criteria match.
    *   Rules have an **order** field for precedence.
*   **Rule Application:**
    *   Applied automatically during the preview stage (if enabled via toggle setting) for data derived from Pattern 2 input (and potentially Pattern 1).
    *   **Precedence:** When multiple rules match, the rule with the **lowest order number** (highest priority) takes precedence. The UI for rule management should provide visual feedback on potential overlaps/overrides.
    *   **Re-scoring (MVP):** The system must allow authorized users (via Admin Panel or Data Viewing page) to select existing data and re-apply the current scoring rules.
*   **Storage:** The calculated score must be stored as a dedicated field alongside each chest data entry in the Supabase database.
*   **Rule Management:**
    *   Initial scoring rules for MVP will be pre-defined.
    *   Scoring rules will be managed via the unified Admin Rule Management UI described in Section 3.7.

### 3.9. Data Visualization

This section covers the graphical display of chest data.

*   **Purpose:** Provide visual insights into personal and clan performance based on chest data.
*   **Location:**
    *   **Dashboard Components (MVP):** Key summary charts and statistics displayed directly on the Member Dashboard (see Sec 3.5).
    *   **Dedicated Charts/Stats Page (MVP):** A dedicated page must provide more detailed charts and statistics, allowing for deeper analysis than the dashboard summaries. This page should offer more chart types and potentially more filtering/grouping options (e.g., filter by date range, player, source).
*   **Chart Types (Examples - MVP):**
    *   Bar/Pie chart: Chest counts by type.
    *   Bar chart: Chest counts/Total score by player (top N players).
    *   Line chart: Score accumulated over time (personal/clan).
    *   Table: Summary statistics (e.g., total chests, total score, average score per chest).
    *   (Specific charts for dashboard vs. dedicated page to be finalized during design/implementation).
*   **Data Filtering:** Charts must reflect the appropriate data scope (personal data based on user's linked game aliases, or overall clan data).
*   **Technology:** Utilize a suitable JavaScript charting library compatible with the tech stack. Potential options include **Recharts**, **Nivo**, or **Chart.js**. Selection based on ease of integration, feature set, and performance.

### 3.10. Data Viewing & Editing

This section describes the interface for interacting with committed chest data in the database.

*   **Purpose:** Allow authorized users to browse, search, modify, and delete the clan's historical chest data.
*   **Interface:** A dedicated page featuring an interactive table view displaying data queried from Supabase.
*   **Table Features:**
    *   Display all relevant columns (incl. Chest Collected Date, `createdAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedAt`, `updatedBy`, `min_level`, `max_level`).
    *   Sorting by any column.
    *   Filtering based on criteria across one or more columns.
    *   **Pagination:** Must be implemented to efficiently handle large datasets.
*   **Inline Editing:** Users with `data:edit` permission can directly edit cell values within the table.
*   **Batch Operations (MVP):**
    *   Users must be able to select multiple rows.
    *   Provide functionality for **Batch Edit** (e.g., change the Source for all selected rows) and **Batch Delete** for selected rows (subject to `data:batch_edit` / `data:batch_delete` permissions).
*   **Visual Highlighting:** The table must display the current validation/correction status of data using the same visual cues as the preview table.
*   **Permissions:** Access to view the data (`data:view`) might be broad, but editing (`data:edit`) and batch operations must be strictly controlled.
*   **Audit Trail:** All direct data modifications (single edits, batch edits, deletions) made through this interface must be logged, recording the user ID, timestamp, affected row(s), and nature of the change.
*   **Data Integrity:** Edits made through this interface directly modify the data in the Supabase database. Changes should potentially trigger re-validation or status updates.

### 3.11. Event Calendar

Provides a shared calendar for clan-related events.

*   **View:** Display a calendar (e.g., monthly view) showing upcoming events.
*   **Event Creation:** Users with `event:create` permission can create new **single-occurrence** events (recurring events are post-MVP).
    *   Event details: Title, Date/Time (start/end), Description, Location (if applicable), Target Clan(s).
*   **Event Editing/Deletion:** Users with `event:edit`/`event:delete` permission can modify or delete existing events.
*   **Integration:** Events can potentially be linked to or mentioned in News articles/Announcements.
*   **Visibility:** Events are typically visible to all members of the targeted clan(s).

### 3.12. Member Directory

Allows members to see who else is in their clan(s).

*   **View:** A page displaying a list or grid of members.
*   **Filtering/Sorting:** Ability to filter the directory by Clan and potentially sort by Rank or Name.
*   **Displayed Information:** For each member, show:
    *   Website Display Name/Alias.
    *   Assigned Rank(s).
    *   Assigned Clan(s).
    *   User-provided Game Account Aliases.
    *   (Profile Picture/Icon based on Rank - TBD asset).
*   **Permissions:** Visible to all authenticated members (excluding Guests).

### 3.13. Private Messaging & Notifications

Enables communication between members and system alerts.

*   **Private Messaging (MVP - Basic):**
    *   Users with `message:send:private` permission can send direct messages to other individual users within their clan(s).
    *   A simple inbox/messaging interface is required.
    *   Basic text messaging is sufficient for MVP.
*   **Admin Broadcasts:** Users with `message:send:broadcast` permission (e.g., Admin+) can send messages to all members of a specific Clan.
*   **Notifications System:**
    *   A mechanism to display notifications to users (e.g., a notification icon in the header/navbar).
    *   **Notification Triggers (Examples):**
        *   New News Article/Announcement published for their clan.
        *   Comment reply in a discussion they are involved in.
        *   New private message received.
        *   Article submitted for approval (for Editors+).
        *   Upcoming event reminder.
    *   Users should be able to mark notifications as read (**automatically upon viewing** the notification list/details).
    *   Notification settings (choosing which types to receive) are post-MVP.

### 3.14. Multi-language Support

Ensures the application interface is available in multiple languages.

*   **Languages (Initial):** German (de) as the default language, English (en) as the secondary language.
*   **Implementation:** Use a standard internationalization (i18n) library compatible with Next.js (e.g., `next-i18next`, `react-intl`).
*   **Scope:** All user-facing UI text (labels, buttons, messages, etc.) must be translatable.
*   **Language Selection:**
    *   Users can select their preferred language in their Profile Settings.
    *   The application should attempt to detect the user's browser language preference on first visit (before login or if no preference is set).
*   **Content:** User-generated content (articles, comments, messages) is *not* automatically translated. The language preference only affects the application's UI strings.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### 4.1 Community Hub
*Given* a clan member visits the landing page  
*When* they view announcements and news sections  
*Then* they see pinned announcements and a news feed filtered by their clan(s).

### 4.2 Data Analysis
*Given* a clan member has chest CSV data  
*When* they upload via the data import feature  
*Then* they see parsed results, can commit, and get a confirmation.

### 4.3 Profile Management
*Given* an authenticated user  
*When* they update their profile fields
